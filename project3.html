        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pv_schematic.png" alt="PV Schematic Overview" /></span>

        <p>This project presents an advanced solar energy system that integrates rooftop PV, solar windows, and Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV), combined with AI-enabled performance optimization and real-time IoT monitoring. The objective was to achieve high energy self-sufficiency and smart energy control across diverse urban settings.</p>

        <h2>Project Highlights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Achieved up to <strong>78% energy self-sufficiency</strong> in simulated buildings.</li>
          <li>Deployed ML models to optimize PV component configuration and energy dispatch.</li>
          <li>Compared energy yield across <strong>multiple global cities</strong> with varying weather and sunlight profiles.</li>
          <li>Enabled real-time remote performance analytics and fault detection using <strong>IoT and ThingSpeak</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>System Architecture</h2>
        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ml_architecture.png" alt="Machine Learning Architecture" /></span>
        <p>AI algorithms were trained on environmental and solar datasets to forecast energy generation, adjust loads dynamically, and recommend system configurations for peak efficiency.</p>

        <h2>IoT Monitoring & Cloud Dashboard</h2>
        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/thingSpeak_demo.png" alt="ThingSpeak IoT Dashboard" /></span>
        <p>ThingSpeak was used as the real-time dashboard interface to visualize live data including solar irradiance, system voltage/current, temperature, and efficiency metrics. Alert mechanisms were included for anomaly detection and system diagnostics.</p>

        <h2>Simulation & Performance Comparison</h2>
        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/city_comparison.png" alt="Performance Across Cities" /></span>
        <p>The blended system was tested across cities like Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, London, and New York. Simulations showed high consistency in energy gains with minor location-specific tuning, making the system <strong>globally deployable</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Energy Management Layout</h2>
        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/simulation_layout.png" alt="Simulation Layout" /></span>
        <p>The layout demonstrates interactions between PV units, inverters, batteries, smart controllers, and building loads. The system also includes predictive fault isolation and recovery features.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project highlights a scalable, AI-enhanced, and IoT-enabled photovoltaic architecture suitable for modern urban sustainability goals. It contributes toward practical deployment of net-zero buildings and bridges the gap between smart monitoring and energy-efficient hardware.</p>
