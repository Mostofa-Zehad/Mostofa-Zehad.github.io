        <p>This project explores a fully photovoltaic (PV)-powered building energy model incorporating rooftop, window-integrated, and semitransparent PV systems. The goal is to optimize energy self-sufficiency while reducing carbon emissions through intelligent simulation, machine learning, and cloud-integrated monitoring.</p>

        <!-- 1. Problem Statement -->
        <h2>1. Problem Statement & Motivation</h2>
        <p>Modern buildings face challenges integrating renewable energy without compromising design or functionality. Traditional PV solutions lack flexibility and holistic energy insights. This project proposes a scalable architecture utilizing multiple PV surfaces and machine learning to boost efficiency, adaptability, and real-time analytics.</p>
